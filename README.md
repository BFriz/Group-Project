# Group-Project
This was the group project that we were assigned in our class (WDI 13). There were 3 of us working together.

Firstly, we decided to get together and brainstorm ideas of what we could build. The brief that we were given from our teachers specified that we needed to use backbone.js, mongo db as the database, and use at least one API.

Discussing ideas together, we decided to come up with a website based around dating/matching people together. Taking the tinder concept and putting our spin on it, the app would make matches of people based on the moods they were in.
We initally came up with several moods for the users to select from but this became complicated, and with the limited 4 days we had to produce a product, we decided to simplify and limit it to 4 moods to choose from.

We then sketched out screens of how pages would look and came up with a basic design concept. The group then decided who would do what within the group. We decided that incorporating a Facebook login feature for the users (to be able to make matches) would be cool to include as facebook logins are very common/popular with websites and it would be working with a new API too.
Another member of the group wrote the majority of the backbone.js code as they were very confident with doing this, and helped with using the database to make matches with the users based on their moods and interests.
Finally, the last member of the group worked with another API, the Google Maps API as it was decided that it would be impressive if there could also be a map showing the location of the user and what mood they were in (with their permission seeked first) and have it be updated in real time on the app.

Once the core features of the website were built, we worked together to push our seperate github branches together to make sure everything was added and there were no merge conflicts, working together to sort through problems as and when they arose.

We acheived the majority of our goals by the deadline, and a chat feature was also included near the end as another addition to the original spec, but it worked.

The only thing lacking on the due date was styling, which is something we should of spent more time on during the production, especially as it was not a strong point any of us had.

However, since the project was finished, we continued to work on the styling, using Bootstrap to help, and created a logo for the name of the website (Moodee) making it look much cleaner and refreshed than the original.
